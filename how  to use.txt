here is a example of calling "letter eliminator'

  # main.py
from cool_stuff import CedarsSubCommands

# Define the parameters for the command you want to run
Command = "letter eliminator"  #can also be "dice roller"
arg_1 = "jeff"  #this is the input word             for dice roller this would be the number of sides of the dice
arg_2 = "f"  #this is the letters to eleminate      for dice roller this would be the number of dice to roll

# Instantiate CedarsSubCommands with the command and arguments
cedar = CedarsSubCommands(Command, arg_1, arg_2)

# Call the method whithout ui 
cedar.c_commands_headless(Command, arg_1, arg_2)
# Call the method whith ui
cedar.c_commands()
